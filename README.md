# raw-camera-filesorter

commercial photographers sometimes take thousands of photos in a single shoot and often send compressed versions of their photos to the client for them to pick which
photos they want to keep
they then have to manually match these with the raw files one by one and it can take a long time

this script automates that process, finding the matches and moving them to a sorted folder
